<p>Last updated: September 08, 2017</p>
<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Deload mobile application (the "Service") operated by Deload Inc. ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong></p>
<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Deload Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your Apple iTunes account.</p>
<p><strong>Fee Changes</strong></p>
<p>Deload Inc., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>Deload Inc. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
<p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>
<p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
